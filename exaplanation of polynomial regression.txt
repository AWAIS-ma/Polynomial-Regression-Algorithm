Polynomial Regression: Complete Overview

Polynomial Regression is a supervised machine learning technique used to
model non-linear relationships between an independent variable (X) and a
dependent variable (y) by fitting a polynomial equation to the data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. What is Polynomial Regression?

Polynomial Regression extends Linear Regression by allowing the model to
learn curved, non-linear patterns.
Instead of fitting a straight line, it fits a curve that minimizes the
error between predicted and actual values.

General form:

y = β0 + β1x + β2x² + β3x³ + … + βnxⁿ + ε

-   β values = model coefficients
-   n = degree of polynomial
-   ε = error term

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Why Use Polynomial Regression?

You use polynomial regression when:

-   The data shows curved or non-linear trends
-   Linear regression underfits
-   You want better flexibility without using complex models

Examples:
- Temperature vs. electricity usage
- Speed vs. braking distance
- Growth patterns
- Biological/chemical measurements

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Key Characteristics

-   Captures non-linear patterns
-   Easy to implement
-   Works well for small to medium datasets
-   More interpretable than neural networks
-   Uses linear regression underneath (on transformed features)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. How It Works (Step-by-Step)

Step 1: Expand features

Convert X → [x, x², x³, …, xⁿ].

Step 2: Fit a linear regression model

Model learns coefficients for each term.

Step 3: Predict using polynomial equation

Predictions follow the fitted curve.

5. Degree Selection

Choosing the right polynomial degree is crucial:

-   Degree 1 → Linear Regression
-   Degree 2 → Quadratic curve
-   Degree 3 → Cubic curve
-   Higher degrees → more flexibility but risk overfitting

Rule: Keep the degree small (2 or 3) unless required.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Advantages

-   Models non-linear relationships efficiently
-   Simple and interpretable
-   Works with small datasets
-   Smooth curve fitting

------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. Disadvantages

-   High-degree polynomials cause overfitting
-   Sensitive to outliers
-   Produces extreme curves at edges (Runge’s phenomenon)
-   Not ideal for very complex patterns

------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. Applications

-   Forecasting and trends
-   Economics and finance
-   Weather and climate analysis
-   Engineering modeling
-   Health and biological growth tracking
-   Energy usage prediction

------------------------------------------------------------------------

9. Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate performance:

-   Mean Squared Error (MSE)
-   Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
-   R² Score
-   Adjusted R²

These help determine whether the polynomial degree is appropriate.

10. Example Polynomial Regression Steps (Python)

1.  Load data
2.  Split into training/testing sets
3.  Transform features using PolynomialFeatures
4.  Train LinearRegression model
5.  Evaluate performance
6.  Visualize the curve

------------------------------------------------------------------------

11. Overfitting & Underfitting

-   Underfitting → degree too low
-   Overfitting → degree too high
-   Optimal fit → choose degree via cross-validation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

12. Summary

Polynomial Regression is a powerful extension of linear regression that
models curved relationships using polynomial transformations. It is
simple, interpretable, and widely used across scientific and engineering
fields. Choosing the right polynomial degree is critical for effective
model performance.
